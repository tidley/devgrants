# Project Description

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:

- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.

Market pressure and regulatory bodies perpetually demand higher performing products at lower cost.
Product development cycles generate test data that are stored on centralised servers.
Bespoke server-side software packages that can provide the required data management tools such as storage, backup, verification, publishing and access control are available for a premium.
Servers operating in isolation unnecessarily restrict access to test data.
Inter-facility data sharing rarely occurs due to network security concerns.
Data retrieval requires licensed and configured client software and access to company networks.
Global manufacturing networks require components to be shipped in order to test.
Shipping takes time, risks damage, and costs money.
Tests could be carried out locally but data cannot be readily shared between facilities.

- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

Profitability can be maintained by reducing development costs in a range of areas.
Cryptographically-secure data sharing opens data sharing potentials.
Open-source software is secure, license-free and typically compatible by design.
Reducing the number of gateways and increasing the quality of security protocols de-restricts rightful data access.
Generic software tools can be used to access data.
Ubiquitous broadband internet enables high volumes of data to be transferred between facilities in real-time.
Bringing testing equipment online facilitates distributed testing.

## Value

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

The automotive industry is becoming increasingly reliant on data and there's pressure to increase the digitisation to recover dropping vehicle sales. As data becomes a backbone of the industry the economic incentive to store data with reliability will increase.

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

The industry will adapt to the data demands.

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

The automotive industry is enormous and there are some major players in the field (AVL etc.)

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

1. Live test data being stored and visible by authenticated users.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:

- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
