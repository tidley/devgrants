# Project Description

_Q_

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:

- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.

_A_

Automotive powertrain test facilities are made up of corridors with test cells on either side containing computer-controlled test instrumentation. Test data are recorded from these instruments and analysed by development engineers.

Before analysis the test data must be made available since files may be created by multiple devices with differing levels of network connectivity. The methods for collating data files will vary between test facilities depending on network architecture and the techniques used by engineers, but there will be several similarities with inherent drawbacks:

**1. Relational databases (SQL, Oracle) running on server-grade hardware with configurable client software**

- Artificial restrictions set by the suppliers (number of active connections, feature sets, CPU cores).
- Physical restrictions created by the infrastructure (network bandwidth, data media read/write speeds).
- Multiple single points of failure on the network and host machine (connection issues, power loss, corrupt media).

**2. Networked machines, both where the data originates and employee devices**

- Data accessed directly from the source can cause excessive wear on storage medium that weren't designed for high numbers of read/write operations.
- Over-use of the local CPU to serve data can cause performance issues if running test software.
- Dispersed, un-checked copies of data increases data storage waste and reduces data integrity.

**3. Network-share drives with access configured using domain controllers and active directories often running on VM's (Windows Server)**

- Data files can easily be miss-placed and duplicated by employees leading to confusion as to the integrity of data.
- Folder access permissions are granted on a per-user and user-group basis which can become unwieldy with multiple data locations and transitioning employee roles.

**4. Removable media such as USB hard-drives and pen-drives**

- Data are much more likely to be lost when carried on a person.
- Data are more corruptible since removable media storage hardware are designed with fewer read/write cycles than even consumer-grade physical storage media such as SSD's and hard drives.

**5. E-mails**

- Unnecessary use of email servers to store test data.
- Data are only accessible by employees who received the e-mail.
- Unless data are e-mailed it is not necessarily accessible by project engineers.

The volume of data being generated by a single test cell (~1 gigabyte / minute) can put a strain on IT infrastructure and create bottlenecks at servers and network switches. These bottlenecks are process inefficiencies and the time spent by engineers waiting for data is a direct cost to businesses as a result.

_Q_

- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

_A_

Using an IPFS cluster will distribute the computational load. Unused computer capacity (CPU clock cycles, hard-drive space, network connectivity... ) can be borrowed to perform processing, storage and distribution of data.

A GUI front-end on a suitable database (OrbitDB) will allow engineers to quickly search for and find their data; the IPFS cluster can then efficiently deliver data on request.

Excessive duplication of data is avoided with 3 copies pinned at any one time.

Once a set time is elapsed (e.g. 1 year after last accessed) a file is marked as being able to be removed from the IPFS network. Files are copied to long-term storage (Filecoin) the moment they're generated to preserve the original data.

## Value

_Q_

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

_A_

A successful implementation at one facility could be readily mimicked at other facilities, which have similar requirements.

The requirements are highly demanding in terms of data storage, access and retrieval.

- Data generated by automotive engineering powertrain facilities is high-volume and high-value.
- Concepts such as 'big-data' is driving the industry to push for access to an increasing volume of digital information.
- The automotive engineering industry is highly compatible with the reductions in development costs made possible by data-driven processes such as CAD and DoE.
- Computer-controlled measurement equipment allows improvements in techniques according to Moore's law.

_Q_

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

_A_

- Loss of confidence in distributed data solutions leading to a lack of potential for future projects.

_Q_

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

_A_

- Non-standard operating systems, computer hardware and networks.
- Operational facilities will want to avoid interruptions to producing and processing data whilst migrating to a new system.
- Projects that have already started may find it difficult to transition to a novel network architecture.

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

_Q_

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

_A - Specification_

1. Large data files (recorded at MHz frequency generating ~10GB in 1.5 minutes, or ~111MB/s\*) every 2 minutes must be able to be processed by the network. Processing includes:
   - Registered on OrbitDB.
   - Having 3 duplicates locally plus on Filecoin.
2. Registered users having access to new files.
   - Show available files with metadata.
3. User administration and authentication.

_A - Functionality_

1. New data files on specific machines are detected and replicated to the local IPFS cluster as well as Filecoin.
2. OrbitDB updated with new file information.
3. Intuitive, permissioned, data-access portal for users.
   - OrbitDB with information on each file (time, origin, # copies, locations, etc.)
4. Access right management controlled by a private key.
   - Read from an IPNS address.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

1. Data from several sources are duplicated to a dedicated IPFS cluster to isolate performance when processing high-volumes of data.
   - Determine e.g. if data read values should be limited when there's an active test to reduce system loading.
2.

3. Executable files to setup:

   _Storage nodes_

   1. Install required software to communicate on IPFS.
      - Detects hard drive read/write speed, network speed etc. to generate system score.
   2. Menu for configuring things such as:
      - Database directory
      - % HDD to leave free
      - Bootstrap nodes
   3. Identifies and registers self on network.

   _Admin portal_

   1. Provides relevant admin features to monitor and configure the network

   _Data origins_

   1. Installs required software to communicate on IPFS.
   2. Provides custom instrument configuration menu to define data source including:
      - Interface (ethernet, serial)
      - Internal / external (mirror or read)
      - Timings (baud rate etc.)
      - Data directory (if to monitor folder for new files)
   3. Identifies and registers self on network.

## 2. Executable to run on each oracle which:

- Provides relevant admin features to monitor and configure the network.
